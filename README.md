California Housing Price Prediction:


This project involves predicting California housing prices using various data preprocessing techniques and a linear regression model. The steps include loading the dataset, handling missing data, encoding categorical data, standardizing features, selecting features, and building and evaluating a linear regression model.


The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of building a linear regression model to predict housing prices in California. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset. This dataset includes various features such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median house value, and more.

Installation:
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

Techniques Used
1. Loading Dataset:
 load the dataset using pandas.


2. Handling Missing Data:
 handle missing data by either filling in missing values or dropping missing data.

3. Handling Categorical Data:
 encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding.

4. Standardization:
 standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance.


5. Linear Regression Model:
 build and evaluate a linear regression model.


The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics. These metrics provide insight into the accuracy and effectiveness of the linear regression model in predicting housing prices
